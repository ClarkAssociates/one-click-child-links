### SDK version issues

Microsoft caused the SDK init to fail when getting the current context for the package `azure-devops-extension-sdk` for versions 3.1.3 -> 4.0.2. The latest version is 4.0.2. This is a known issue and is being tracked in [this github issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-devops-extension-sdk/issues/116)
